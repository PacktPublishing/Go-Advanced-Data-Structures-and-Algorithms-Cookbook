## Subtitle: 
Use Your Basic Go Data Structures and Algorithms knowledge to develop solutions

## Target Audience 
This comprehensive book is for developers who have basic go programming skills and knowledge in basic Go Data structures & algorithms.

## Short Description
Go-Advanced-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Cookbookcovers topics related to  advanced and complex concepts in computer programming. This book provides solutions to real world problems using data structures and algorithms.

## Long Description
Golang has been the buzzword for the last 2 years with tremendous improvements being done in the language. Many developers and organizations are slowly migrating to Golang, adopting its fast, lightweight and inbuilt concurrency features. This brings the need to have a advanced knowledge in data structures and algorithms with this growing language.

This book is for one who wants to take their datastructures knowledge to next level from basic.Moving a step forward from basic data structures, this book will  teach you how to apply traditional data structures to solve real-world problems such as cryptography, genetic algorithms, compiler design, markov chains, search engines, dynamic programming and simulation are presented in the book.

Instance Based Learning, Compiler Translation and Process Scheduling  can be implemented using Graphs, List of Lists, AVL Trees, K-D Trees, Ball Trees, Van Emde Boas Trees, Buffer Trees and Red-Black Trees. Reader can come up with solutions related to  Shortest Path Analysis, Connectivity Analysis, Route Planning, Markov Chain, Genetic algorithms, Random Walk & Approximation algorithms using Directed & Undirected Graphs, Clustering Graphs, Vectors, Adjacency Matrix & Adjacency Lists.


## Key Features
1. Apply common data structures and algorithms in different solutions
2. Use data structures with real-world examples and develop web & mobile apps
3. Develope the functional and reactive implementations of the traditional data structures

## What you will learn?
1. See how to improve the application performance using right data structure and algorithm in web and mobile applications.
2. Enumerate solutions to a problem and identify algorithms and data structures after doing the trade-off analysis of costs and benefits.
3. Get a grasp on techniques to write pseudo code for an algorithm and ace in white boarding or interviewing situations.
4. Discover the pitfalls in selecting data structures and algorithms by predicting how fast and efficient is an algorithm or a data structure.

## Metadescription
Explore Golang’s Data Structures and Algorithms that will help you Design, Implement, and Analyze Code in Practical/Professional setting.
